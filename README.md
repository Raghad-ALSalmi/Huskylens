# Huskylens
In this project, I trained the Huskylens device to recognize and classify objects. The image shows the device identifying and labeling the “chair” objects in its view. This real-time object recognition is powered by machine learning algorithms, allowing Huskylens to classify different objects accurately in various environments.
